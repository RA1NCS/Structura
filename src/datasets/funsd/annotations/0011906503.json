The CTS400 has the additional measurement of, cigarette hardness in comparison with the CTS300. With this added, measurement R&D will, be able to replace the Firmness Integrator that measures cigarette firmness in, to other addition, measurements that are mentioned above. The Firmness Integrator is no longer, manufactured and parts are becoming difficult to obtain. Lastly,  of this, provide similar capability as the Macon Plant and help facilitate, comparisions between laboratories.", "Purpose": "1, X Maintenance of Existing Business", "Approved;": "", "Yr._3": "", "CAPITAL_3": "", "EXPENSE_3": "", "JAN.": "", "-MAR.": "", "APR.": "", "-JUN.": "", "JUL.": "", "-DEC": "", "TOTAL_2": "", "EXPENSE_4": "", "CAPITAL_4": "", "-SEP": "", "OCT.": "", "EXPENSE_5": "", "CAPITAL_5": "", "Date Submitted": "", "Capital Budget": "", "This Project is": "", "Proposal No.": "", "Approved by": "", "[OTHER]": ["0465E", "($000)", "621099940J", "FA 956 (5- 85)", "g1 0081.
