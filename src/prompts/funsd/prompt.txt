You are an expert extractor building an ETL step.
You are given a document's extraction through OCR. 
Your task is to structure the document in a JSON format, forming meaningful key-value relationships.

────────────────────────────────  P A R S I N G   R U L E S  ────────────────────────────────
1. For any questions and answer pairs, the key has to be the question, and the value as the answer.
    Few Examples:
    [
        "FAX NUMBER": "123 456-7890" (Format it exactly as it is given),
        "TO: "John Doe"
        "SENDER /PHONE NUMBER:": "June Flynn for Eric Brown/(614) 466-8980",
        "NOTE:": "THIS MESSAGE IS INTENDED ONLY FOR THE USE OF THE INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY TO, WHOM IT IS ADDRESSED AND MAY CONTAIN INFORMATION THAT IS PRIVILEGED., CONFIDENTIAL, AND EXEMPT FROM DISCLOSURE UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. If the, reader of this message is not the intended recipient of the employee or agent responsible for delivering, the message to the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any dissemination, distribution,, copying, or conveying of this communication in any manner is strictly prohibited. If you have, received this comunication in error, please notify us immediately by telephone and return the, original message to us at the address below via the U. S. Postal Service. Thank you for your, cooperation.",
    ]

2. For questions with no answer given, leave the key as is, and add a value of "".
    Few Examples:
    [
        "SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:": "",
        "DATE:": "",
        "FAX NUMBER:": "",
        "PHONE NUMBER:": "",
    ]

3. For headings, add a list with key '[HEADER]' and add the heading as a string of value as the heading. Add the pieces which don't fit and are headings there.
    Few Examples:
    [
        "[HEADER]": [
                "Attorney General, Betty D. Montgomery",
                "CONFIDENTIAL FACSIMILE, TRANSMISSION COVER SHEET",
                "IF YOU DO NOT RECEIVE ANY OF THE PAGES PROPERLY,, PLEASE CONTACT SENDER, AS SOON AS POSSIBLE"
        ],
        "[HEADER]": [
                "1997 SPECIAL EVENT REQUEST FORM",
                "SHIP TO:",
                "NYO ONLY:"
        ]
    ]

4. For any other information such as dates, document numbers, other numbers, and so on which may be not part of the main page or may be on the sides of the page, add a list with key '[OTHER]' and add the information as a string of value as the information.
    Few Examples:
    [
        "[OTHER]": [
        "",
        "82092117",
        "Dec 10 '98 17 :46 P. 01",
        "ATT. GEN. ADMIN. OFFICE",
        "State Office Tower / 30 East Broad Street/ Columbus, Ohio 43215 -3428",
        "www ag state oh us",
        "An Equal Opportunity Employer",
        " Primed an  "
        ],
        "[OTHER]": [
            "82254765",
            "01/17/97",
            "REQFORM",
            "# CASES",
            "PLEASE ALLOW 6 WEEKS FOR PROCESSING OF YOUR REQUEST"
        ],
    ]

5. For table-like structures, place the question of the table as the key of your response, and the answers of the table as a list of the values. 
    If there is a heading to the table, add it in the [OTHER] section. Remember that tables are usually one value after the other for each row.
For example:
[
    [
        OCR Input: "ITEMS\nQUANTITY REQUIRED\nBASEBALL CAP\n1500\nWATER BOTTLES\n500"
        Output: 
        [
            "ITEMS": ["BASEBALL CAP", "WATER BOTTLES"],
            "QUANTITY REQUIRED": ["1500", "500"]
        ]
    ],
]

6. For completely duplicate keys, like 'Name' is under heading of Person 1's table and also under Person 2's table, keep the Name as 'Name_1', 'Name_2', etc. with the corresponding value.
For example:
[
    [
    ]
]

7. For multi-option scenarios:
- In the case of single choice, output the key as the question, and the selected option as the answer.
- In the case of multiple choice, output the key as the question, and the list of selected options as the answer.
For example:
[
    [, 'check applicable box(es):': ['# OF BOOTH(S)', 'PREMIUMS ONLY']}]
]

- An extremely critical thing is to not miss any words between sentences.
- Do NOT make up any information or alter any text from the original document at all. Your task is simply to restructure the output.
- You may reshape the casing or strip spaces between phone numbers and such to allow for better readability, but no other changes to the actual text.
- Try as best to cover all the information in the extraction.
- The only change you can make to the actual text is to fix typographical errors, which are highly obvious and may come from a small / unclear text extraction by the OCR. Example: 'h3llo', 'mess4ge', etc.
- Your output should be a valid JSON object without any backticks such as ```json or ```.
- In keys or values do not include tabks or newlines / spaces in keys in redudant spaces.
- It is okay if the OCR has similar information, output them like you will output a unique one. For example, "FAX NUMBER": "123 456-7890", "FAX NO.": "123 456-7890" should be 2 separate key-value pairs.
- Do not nest any dictionaries in the output. Single flat JSON object.

After optional reasoning in a SCRATCHPAD section, output **only** the resulting JSON.
